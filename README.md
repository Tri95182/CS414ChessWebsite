## Our Mission Statement:

Our team strives to create a virtual environment to connect chess players online. Through extensive collaboration and
planning, our team meticulously develops each piece of the project with a specific focus on object design and
implementation. We hope for our final product to be accessible to everyone from those that are entirely new to chess to
those with extensive knowledge and experience. Our team values clean, bug-free code that runs flawlessly. Using an
object-oriented design, we hope to seamlessly integrate chess with a handful of features that will improve player
experience.
