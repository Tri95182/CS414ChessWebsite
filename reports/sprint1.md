## Review

### Epics completed

We completed the planning of our user stories and tasks. From their, we designed modeling diagrams using a UML diagram
and CRC cards. We established a kanban board to track our progress. The last epic we completed was a presentation of our
progress for P1.

### Epics not completed

We completed everything we set out for this project milestone.

## Retrospective

### Things that went well

Our team actively communicated during this sprint. We instantly had team chemistry. When it was necessary, we came
together to complete tasks and epics. Our cohesiveness allowed us to make group decisions that helped us reach the P1
milestone.

### Things that we need to improve

We had problems meeting regularly due to conflicting schedules. One team member who was a full-time worker left our team
at the end of the sprint. This has allowed us to meet on a regular schedule. With regular meetings, it will be easier to
hold each other accountable. Thus, leading to quicker completion of tasks.

### One thing we will change next time

We plan on increasing the frequency of our scrums. In addition, we plan to have one in-person scrum a week.
