## Review

### Epics completed
Our team was able to finish both special moves epics. One for en passant and the other was for pawns. We were also able to create schemas so a user can 
see a list of all active games on the client.

### Epics not completed
Our team still needs to finish making our website usable.

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
Certain team members displayed a high level of communication. When necessary, the team was able to meet and accomplish important tasks.

### Things that we need to improve
Our team needs to work more consistently on the epics. Communication also declined due to fall break.

### One thing we will change next time
Better planning and getting an earlier start on the project.
