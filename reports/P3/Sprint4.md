## Review

### Epics completed
Our team was able to implement mongodb. We successfully created requests using a restful api to connect our client to the server. The database is used to store user information and game data.

### Epics not completed
Our team still needs to complete epics that have to do with the client.

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
We were able to come together and finish work when necessary. Our team also had comprehensive reviews of all pull requests.

### Things that we need to improve
Our team did a poor job with communication and meeting. 

### One thing we will change next time
Our team plans on working more frequently on the project.
