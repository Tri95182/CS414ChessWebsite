## Review

Our team was able to complete the move functionality for every piece. We also were able to successfully set up a login page. Our chessboard is initialized on our client and we used the react - chessboard library. 

### Epics not completed
Our team was not able to finish the Invite, gameplay, or stat epic.

### One thing we will change next time
Our team plans on working more frequently on the project.
